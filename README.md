## Architecture

The app follows the **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** architecture pattern:

- **Model:** Represents movie data (`MovieData`) and repository operations (`MovieRepository`).
- **ViewModel:** Manages the UI state and communicates with the repository to handle data operations.
- **View (Compose):** Contains the composables that render the UI and react to state changes from the ViewModel.

## Dependencies

- **Jetpack Compose:** For building declarative UI.
- **Material3:** Latest Material Design components.
- **Kotlin Coroutines & State Management:** For asynchronous data handling and state updates.

## Prerequisites

- **Android Studio Bumblebee (or later):** Required to build and run the app.
- **Kotlin 1.7+**
- **Gradle 7.2+**
